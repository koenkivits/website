The new year is slowly approaching. Time to look back on the past year and set resolutions for next one. For me this usually means confirming I didn't really achieve what I wanted, and ending with a well-spirited "but next year will be _my year_." But this year will be different!

<!-- more -->

Because one of this year's resolutions was to start writing more. Not because I fancy myself a writer, but because of all the things involved in writing: organizing your thoughts and telling a story; things I really want to get better at. And the best way to get better at something is to do it often.


## I told you so...

... or maybe not? You probably recognize this scenario: a project is failing and you try to convince your team or management to go in a new direction. You fail at convincing them, the project ultimately fails, and in hindsight your idea might have been better. There's a bit of cheap satisfaction in exclaiming "I told you so!", but you wouldn't be helping anybody.

Now, I don't think I'm always right — being together with my wife for 11 years has put an end to that illusion —, but every time an "I told you so" occured it was also very much my fault. Usually I'm pretty capable of reasoning about problems and solutions, but to translate my thoughts into a string of coherent sentences has never been my strong suit. Of course people won't listen.

Most of these times it would have helped if I had at least collected my thoughts on paper: it would have allowed me to have a look from the outside and catch any questions and problems that may arise. Not only would I have had a clearer story to tell; I'd also be better prepared for an argument.


## Not just communication

Writing things down doesn't come naturely to me: I rarely take notes and I try to retain as much information as possible inside my head alone. Up until college this 'system' performed wonderfully, so there wasn't really a reason to change. As you grow older you gain more responsibilities however, and with more responsibilities comes more stuff to remember. And there's a hard cap on how much information your brain can juggle at a time.

That's when I started writing down all 'simple' things I had to remember — todo items, appointments, etc. — and it really helps with reducing my stress levels. Now I'm expanding into writing about things I've learned and about ideas I have. Visited a conference? _Write about it!_ Have a vague idea about how writing can improve your life? _Write about it!_

Don't just take my word for it. Check out [The Psychological Benefits of Writing](https://www.helpscout.net/blog/benefits-of-writing/) for a post on (you guessed it) the benefits of writing, with links to research results.


# Back to code

You might wonder how any of this has anything to do with code, but consider this: a huge part of our work has _nothing_ to to with code. Software development is communication and creativity, and there are many ways to get better at it outside of coding.

So I'll keep writing, and this is my starting point. Just in time to check off one of my 2018 resolutions. Happy holidays!
